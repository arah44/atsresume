### Spacing

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- 2-column grids
- Side-by-side CTAs in hero
- Balanced text and visual content

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- 3-column feature grids
- Full hero with visuals
- Larger typography and spacing

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
app/page.tsx (main landing page)
components/
  hero/
    HeroSection.tsx (or .jsx)
    LandingCTA.tsx
  landing/
    ProblemStatement.tsx
    HowItWorks.tsx
    FeaturesGrid.tsx
    SocialProof.tsx (optional)
```

### Key Considerations
1. **Convert to TypeScript**: Change from `page.jsx` to `page.tsx`
2. **Remove Old Builder**: Currently shows `<Builder/>`, replace entirely
3. **Client vs Server**: Mark as `'use client'` if using state/effects, otherwise keep as Server Component
4. **Animations**: Use Framer Motion or CSS animations sparingly for polish
5. **SEO**: Add proper metadata export:
   ```tsx
   export const metadata = {
     title: 'ATSResume - Create ATS-Optimized Resumes in Minutes',
     description: 'Build your profile once, generate tailored resumes for every job application using AI. ATS-friendly, fast, and free to start.',
     openGraph: {
       title: 'ATSResume - AI-Powered Resume Builder',
       description: 'Create ATS-optimized resumes tailored to each job in minutes.',
     }
   }
   ```

### User State Detection
- **Check for existing profile**:
  ```tsx
  const profile = ProfileStorageService.getProfile();
  ```
- **Conditional CTA**:
  - If no profile: "Get Started" ‚Üí `/dashboard/profile`
  - If profile exists: "Go to Dashboard" ‚Üí `/dashboard`

### Performance
- Lazy load below-the-fold content
- Optimize any images/graphics
- Minimize animations on mobile

---

## üöÄ User Experience Flow

### First-Time Visitor
1. Lands on homepage
2. Reads hero and skims how it works
3. Clicks "Get Started" CTA
4. Redirected to `/dashboard/profile`
5. Sees profile creation form (which is empty initially)
6. Fills out form with name and resume content
7. AI generates base resume
8. Redirected to dashboard to see base resume and option to create job-specific resumes

### Returning Visitor (with profile)
1. Lands on homepage
2. Sees "Go to Dashboard" CTA (different from "Get Started")
3. Clicks through to `/dashboard`
4. Sees existing resumes and can create new job-specific ones

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The landing page is successful if:
1. **Clear Value Prop**: User understands what the app does in < 10 seconds
2. **Low Friction**: Prominent, obvious CTA to start profile creation
3. **Trust Building**: Explains process, reduces uncertainty
4. **Responsive**: Works beautifully on all devices
5. **Fast**: Loads quickly, minimal animations
6. **Converts**: Drives users to `/dashboard/profile` to create profile

---

## üéØ Primary Goal
**Get users to click "Get Started" and create their profile.**

Everything on this page should support this single conversion goal.

---

## üìä Optional Enhancements (Future)

- **Video Demo**: Embedded walkthrough video
- **Live Preview**: Mini interactive demo of resume generation
- **Comparison Table**: This app vs manual resume customization
- **FAQ Section**: Common questions about ATS, process, pricing
- **Blog/Resources Link**: Content marketing integration
- **Email Capture**: "Get notified" form if user not ready to commit
- **A/B Testing**: Test different headlines and CTAs

---

## üîó Related Pages

After landing page is implemented, ensure consistency with:
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard after login
- `/dashboard/profile` - Profile creation/editing
- `/dashboard/jobs` - Job listings (if applicable)
- Footer links should point to real pages (create stubs if needed)

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create component structure in `/components/landing/`
3. Implement hero section first (core conversion driver)
4. Build out remaining sections in priority order
5. Add responsive styling and polish
6. Test user flow from landing ‚Üí profile ‚Üí dashboard
7. Optimize performance and SEO
